Remember, everyone is suspicious of you like you are of them! Try not to jump to conclusions without solid evidence! If you mistakenly kill another innocent, you'll lower your odds of winning!

You can prove to everyone you're innocent by successfully killing traitors and confirming their corpses.]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_TRAITOR,
	[[You are a traitor among the innocents. Your goal is to eliminate all the innocents with the help of your traitor buddies... if you have any.

You can open the scoreboard with [{scorekey}] to see who you're teamed up with.
Voice chat with only the traitors using [{teamvoicekey}].

You can buy equipment using credits by pressing [{menukey}] to help with your onslaught. Be careful not to raise any unwanted suspicion with your equipment!

You'll start with a few credits - you can gain more credits by killing enough innocents, killing detectives, and by looting any unused credits off corpses.
You can also give credits to other people using the Transfer tab in the [{menukey}] menu.]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_DETECTIVE,

Everyone knows you're a detective - you have the hat and everything! Including a DNA Scanner that can analyse DNA found on corpses, weapons and bombs to locate potential suspects.

But it would be so funny if someone killed you... it's your goal to have that happen! :)

Trick someone into shooting you by acting suspicious, but don't make it too obvious or you'll be called out as a jester and avoided.

Everyone is alerted when a jester is present at the start of a round, but only the traitors know it's you. Generally, the traitors will keep this knowledge to themselves and just avoid shooting you.

If you die without the aid of another player (like falling to your death), it won't be funny enough and you'll lose.
Blast and fire damage caused by a player will hurt you, but you'll always be left with at least 1 HP from it.]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_SWAPPER,
	[[You are a cheeky swapper! You want to create chaos by letting someone kill you...
When someone does kill you, you and your killer will swap roles. You'll also be revived instantly.

Since dying doesn't mean you win like the jester does, your victory will come from swapping to the innocents side or the traitors side, then fulfilling their goal.

Trick someone into shooting you by acting suspicious, but don't make it too obvious or you'll be called out as a "jester" and avoided.

Everyone is alerted that a "jester" is present at the start of a round, but only the traitors know it's you. Generally, the traitors will keep this knowledge to themselves and just avoid shooting you.

When you die, you'll be revived in the next few seconds with the same role as your killer. They will need to stay alive until then, otherwise your revive will fail!
If you die without the aid of another player (like falling to your death), you won't be able to revive.

Be careful, some people can get cautious of you suddenly being alive again. If you revive onto the traitors side in front of some innocents, you could be in trouble.]])

Like the usual traitor, your goal is to eliminate all the innocents with the help of your traitor buddies.

You can see the name of your randomly selected target in the bottom-left corner. Once you kill your target, you'll immediately get a new one. If you kill someone who isn't your target, you will have no target and no damage bonus for a small amount of time.

Voice chat with only the traitors using [{teamvoicekey}].

You can buy equipment using credits by pressing [{menukey}] to help with your onslaught.

You start with one credit - you can gain more by killing detectives, and by looting any unused credits off corpses.

You have a mesmerist defib! Find a corpse that has an intact brain (ie. they haven't been headshot to death), then revive them with your defib to gain a traitor buddy!

Look out for witnesses before you use your defib. People will get quite suspicious if they see you revive someone.

If you were already confirmed dead, you may want to keep quiet to avoid being asked how you're alive again.

Don't worry if your mesmerist dies, your life isn't tied to them so you can keep going. Avenge them!

You get one credit to spend! Perhaps your mesmerist will be kind enough to send more credits your way?]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_DEFECTOR,
	[[You've picked up a Jihad Bomb from a traitor and converted to their side! Sacrificing yourself sounds fun!

As a defector, you can ONLY deal damage using the bomb you picked up. This means shooting people won't work!

Use it wisely, it will kill you too! For the best results, wait for people to crowd around one spot.

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_DEFECTIVE,
	[[You are an EVIL traitorous detective - a defective! You look like a regular detective to the innocents. Gain their trust and get the real detectives killed!
Like the usual traitor, your goal is to eliminate all the innocents with the help of your traitor buddies.

You and the other detectives cannot harm each other while there are innocents still alive. You need to convince them to kill their detectives for you... or have your traitor friends take them down.

Voice chat with only the traitors using [{teamvoicekey}].

You can buy detective equipment using credits by pressing [{menukey}].

You'll start with a few credits - you can get more by killing enough innocents, and by looting unused credits off corpses. Additionally, you will get an extra credit when a real detective is killed.
You can also give credits to other people using the Transfer tab in the [{menukey}] menu.]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_VAMPIRE,
	[[You are a traitor vampire! Your thirst for blood is insatiable, you will slowly waste away without it...
Harm people in any way to fulfill your bloodlust.
Like the usual traitor, your goal is to eliminate all the innocents with the help of your traitor buddies.

If you melee someone, you will consume their blood and heal up!
You can overheal a sizeable amount if you're already at max health. Don't worry, other people will still see you as "Healthy" while you're overhealed.

Press [{vampirebatkey}] to turn into a "bat", letting you fly around quickly and escape from danger! You can change this bind in the F1's Key Bindings menu.

To control your "bat" form:
▪ Hold no movement keys to let yourself glide.
▪ Hold forward movement while looking around to move in that direction, including up and down.
▪ Jump to launch off the ground. Press jump in mid-air to flap yourself upwards.

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_IMPOSTOR,
	[[Impostor. Among Us. That's your role.
Like the usual traitor, your goal is to eliminate all the innocents with the help of your traitor buddies.

You deal slightly less damage than normal, so if you're going to shoot someone, make it count!
Stand near a player and press [{impostorkillkey}] to instantly kill them. Like in Among Us, this has a lengthy cooldown.

You have a "Vent" weapon in your inventory that lets you place vents to quickly traverse around later. These vents are invisible until they have been used at least once.

You are unable to buy equipment. Instead, you can sabotage lights, comms, oxygen, and the reactor. This can be confusing to control at first, so here's a quick run-down:
▪ Press [{impostorcyclekey}] to cycle through your sabotaging tools. Keep an eye on the bottom-left corner.
▪ Press [{impostorsabotagekey}] to sabotage what you've selected.
▪ You can choose where the sabotage will happen by using the Station Manager. Press [{impostorsabotagekey}] on a crewmate icon to set the sabotage spot there. You can create a new spot by pressing [{impostorsabotagekey}] on a player too.

Being killed marks your killer with dark smoke. If they are killed, you will steal their soul and be revived at your ragdoll!

Your fellow traitors should focus taking out your haunted killer. Hope that the innocents aren't protecting them.

Voice chat with only the traitors using [{teamvoicekey}].

You don't care what's really going on - making sure your patients are healthy is all that matters to you!

Use your technologically advanced medigun to heal people by attaching a healing beam to them.

If someone important has gone down, you can revive them with your one-time use defib!

Try not to get yourself involved by killing someone! If you break your oath, you will be stripped of your medical supplies and lose some karma!]])

While you are an amnesiac, you are on neither side. You can still contribute to the killing, but you could weaken the side you end up joining...]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_WRATH,
	[[You are an innocent with a short fuse. If you are wrongly killed, you will come back with a vengeance.

Being killed by another innocent vexes you, thus you will awaken as a traitor. Kill the fuckers.

You aren't aware of your wrath nature. You will only discover it in death. Unless, of course, a traitor kills you.]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_CUPID,
	[[You are Cupid! You want to make two people fall in love and work together! Til death do them part...

Take out your Cupid Crossbow and shoot someone to mark them for love. You can then either choose to shoot another person to make those two people lovers, or you can shoot yourself to become lovers with that person!

Lovers are bound by their hearts. If one takes damage, the other will take damage too. If one dies, the other will soon die from shock.

If one lover is a traitor, the other non-traitor lover will help them as their current role. Love wins!

Once you have used up your crossbow, you will act as an ordinary innocent.]])

AddCustomExplanation(ROLE_BOMBER,

You will see yellow floating orbs around where dead players are spectating. If you see many orbs in one area, there's probably something interesting there!

You can feel when someone has died. This can be useful information for your team if they haven't noticed yet.]])
